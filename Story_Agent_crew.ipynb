But when he arrived, the bush was bare!  \"Oh no!\" cried Barnaby.  \"The berries are gone!\"  Just then, Fiona Fox trotted by.  \"What's wrong, Barnaby?\" she asked.

He confessed to taking everything, planning a private feast.  Seeing the disappointment on their faces, Reginald felt ashamed.  He helped them gather the stolen treats, and everyone worked together to prepare the Forest Feast.
